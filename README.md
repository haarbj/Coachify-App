## Overview

### Description

Coachify is a specialized running app designed to facilitate communication between runners and their coaches, allowing for personalized training plans and performance monitoring. Runners can log their runs, input various metrics such as distance, pace, elevation, and perceived effort, and provide additional context or notes about each session. Coaches can then review this data, analyze trends, and offer tailored recommendations to optimize training and maximize results.
